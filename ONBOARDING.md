_**Welcome to FINN!**_ We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of _making the FINN app great again_! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

Before your first day make sure to agree on an arrival time so there's someone there to welcome you. Make sure to bring your personal computer in case there's any issues with your new shiny hardware. 

On your first day walk into reception and get yourself a temporary access card, a picture will be taken as well. After this you'll be taken to greet the team (across the different spaces). After this you would come to Service desk to get your computer.

To set up your computer you have to know that [Okta](https://schibsted.okta.com) is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (and FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to.
