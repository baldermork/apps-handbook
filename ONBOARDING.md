# Welcome to FINN!

We are happy of having you with us, we have written this guide to get you started in your journey of _making the FINN app great again_! If any of the steps are outdated or any information is missing please send a pull request.

Before your first day make sure to agree on an arrival time so there's someone there to welcome you. Make sure to bring your personal computer in case there's any issues with your new shiny hardware. 

On your first day walk into reception and get yourself a temporary access card, a picture will be taken as well. After this you'll be taken to greet the team (across the different spaces). After this you would come to Service desk to get your computer.

To set up your computer you have to know that [Okta](https://schibsted.okta.com) is your main gateway for all the things Schibsted (and FINN), here you'll find direct links to all the apps you've access to.

# Your first days here

Here's a rough plan of what you'll be doing, we hope you like what we have prepared for you.

## 1st week
Go through your coding challenge and implement improvements following FINN's coding guidelines and development process. The purpose of this is to introduce you in some of our tools and frameworks, you'll most likely implement similar patterns than the ones we use in FINN and will provide valuable feedback so we can improve our internal tooling.

## 2nd week
Implement a recipes app following FINN's coding guidelines and development process. The purpose of this is to introduce you to some of our core architecture choices as well as to the way we style components.

## 3rd week
Implement or improve a shared component from Finnivers and add it to the main app. Our main apps can be big and overwhelming, starting with a small component will help you to get familiar with the app while maintaining focus on a small area of the apps.

## 4rd week
You will start contributing to our main app by solving tasks marked as "starter-tasks" in our Trello board, feel free to include any improvements that you have in mind into the mix, we'll collaborate to solve your doubts as well as to give you insight in any of the decisions we took in the apps. You're part of the team now, your feedback is important for us to improve the way we do things so please share anything that you feel could be better, doesn't matter if it's small or big.
